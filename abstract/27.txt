Web-based collaborative big data analytics on big data as a service platform
As data has been increasing explosively due to development of social networks and cloud computing, there has been a new challenge for storing, processing, and analyzing a large volume of data. The traditional technologies do not become a proper solution to process big data so that a big data platform has begun to emerge. It is certain that big data platform helps users develop analysis service effectively. However, it still takes a long time to collect data, develop algorithms and analytics services. We present a collaborative big data analytics platform for big data as a service. Developers can collaborate with each other on the platform by sharing data, algorithms, and services. Therefore, this paper describes big data analytics platform that effectively supports to manage big data and develop analytics algorithms and services, collaborating with data owners, data scientists, and service developers on the Web. Finally, we introduce a CCTV metadata analytics service developed on the platform.
