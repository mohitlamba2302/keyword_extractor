1A study on big data I/O performance with modern storage systems
High-performance I/O is essential for big-data analyses. Modern storage systems utilize HDDs and SSDs mainly for achieving large capacity and high performance, respectively. Using an SSD as a cache for accesses to HDDs is one of the promising methods for improving large-scale I/O performance in modern computers. In addition, M.2 is increasing its importance in high-performance I/O processing. In this paper, we investigate the I/O performance of storage systems including M.2 SSD and SSD cache. Our experimental results show that big-data processing performance can improve significantly by using an M.2 SSD cache
