Information storage mechanism of the biological neural network
The information storage mechanism of the biological neural network is the most important problem in neuroscience. Our observations showed that the structure of the hippocampus, the core memory of the brain, is very similar to the Hopfield's neural network. An electronic neuronic model was constructed to simulate the dynamic process of the hippocampal LTP process. The kinetic process of the post synaptic potentials and the synaptic-synaptic interaction equations were also discussed. We proposed a dual coding theory of biological neural information and assumed that the messy fiber synaptic glomerulus may be the chief storage medium of the neural information. A geometrical mapping of N dimensional unitron was constructed to analyse the distribution of the computation energy and to trace the dynamic loci in memory retrieve process.
