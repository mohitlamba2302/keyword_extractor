Where big data meets linked data: Applying standard data models to environmental data streams
In August 2015, a new seafloor observatory was deployed in Galway Bay, Ireland. The sensors on the observatory platform are connected by fibre-optic cable to a shore station, where a broadband connection allows data transfer to the Marine Institute's data centre. This setup involved the development of a new data acquisition system which takes advantage of open source streaming data solutions developed in response to the Big Data paradigm, in particular the Velocity aspect. This activity merges concepts from the arenas of both Big Data and Internet of Things where data standardisation is not normally considered. This paper considers the architecture implemented to stream marine data from instrument to end user and offers suggestions on how to standardise these data streams.
