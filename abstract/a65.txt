Stabilization of flexible structures using artificial neural networks
A method of using artificial neural networks to stabilize large flexible space structures is presented. The neural controller learns the dynamics of the structure to be controlled and constructs a control signal to stabilize structural vibrations. The network consists of a three layer feedforward network; the input layer receives the displacement and velocity information from sensors located at various points in the structure, and the output layer generates control signals that are applied to the structure through suitable actuators. Sequential updating of the network weights continues, forcing the structure follow a trajectory that eventually leads to complete stabilization. Simulation results on the stabilization of a flexible beam are presented.
