Meta-analysis of big data security and privacy: Scholarly literature gaps
We collected 79,012 articles from 1916-2016 related to big data to determine which topics were being studied and how much of the literature was focused on privacy or security-related keywords. The analysis demonstrated that the big data paradigm commenced in late 2011 and the research production exponentially rose starting in 2012, which approximated a Weibull distribution that captured 82% of the variance (p<;.01). We found there were 13 dominant topics capturing 49% of the big data production in journals during 2011-2016 but privacy and security topics accounted for only 2% and this trend recently dropped to less than 1% Thus, we argued that we need to stimulate more big data privacy-security research.
