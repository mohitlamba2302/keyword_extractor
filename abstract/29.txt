Towards a big data requirements engineering artefact model in the context of big data software development projects: Poster extended abstract
In this paper, we describe our ongoing research aimed at defining a Requirements Engineering Artefact Model (REAM) in the context of Big Data software applications. This model aims to provide a “big picture” of the Requirements Engineering work products created and used in Big Data software development projects. REAM are important tools that can be used as references for the definition of domain-specific RE models, system life-cycle processes and artefact-centered processes, currently bereft in the Big Data Software Engineering research.
