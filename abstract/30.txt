Sharing best practices for the implementation of Big Data applications in government and science communities
The Federal Big Data Working Group supports the Federal Big Data Initiative but is not endorsed by the Federal Government or its agencies. This working group uses meetups with onsite and virtual participation to share best practices for the implementation of Big Data applications in government and science communities. Decision-makers and the scientific community interact with data science in order to take advantage of the Big Data transformation of how information is used in science, decision support, data discovery and data publishing. The working group federates use cases, data publications, solutions and technologies. The range of topics is illustrated in a keynote and panel discussion at a recent Big Data conference and in a summary of recent working group meetups.
