Big data analytics platform for flight safety monitoring
The conventional methods of data analytics for flight safety monitoring have met many bottlenecks. This paper analyzes the insufficiencies of the preliminary business process of an airline. For the purpose of meeting requirements of efficiency and accuracy and avoiding the drawbacks encountered before, the architectural framework of the flight safety monitoring platform utilizing big data technology is proposed and demonstrated by the function module structure and logical structure. The platform is implemented by dividing the system into five subsystems, namely data acquisition, data decoding, data storage, data analysis and visualization.
