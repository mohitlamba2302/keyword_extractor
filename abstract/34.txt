Some key problems of data management in army data engineering based on big data
This paper analyzed the challenges of data management in army data engineering, such as big data volume, data heterogeneous, high rate of data generation and update, high time requirement of data processing, and widely separated data sources. We discussed the disadvantages of traditional data management technologies to deal with these problems. We also highlighted the key problems of data management in army data engineering including data integration, data analysis, representation of data analysis results, and evaluation of data quality.
