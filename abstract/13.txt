Financial Data Mining Based on Support Vector Machines and Ensemble Learning
With the rapid development of e-commerce, financial data mining has been one of the most important research topics in the data mining community. Support vector machines (SVMs) and ensemble learning are two popular techniques in the machine learning field. In this paper, support vector machines and ensemble learning are used to classify financial data respectively. The experiments conducted on the public dataset show that compared with SVMs, ensemble learning achieves obvious improvement of performance.
