Data science vs big data @ UTM big data centre
Big data tsunami has hit Malaysia recently that has awakening the industry and academy communities to aggressively address the insight, hindsight and foresight challenges ensuring Malaysia to be among the top world players in big data information economy for the next decade. Rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in this era is very significant due to increasing number of users accessing data keeps growing by the time. This phenomenon has been coined as big data. What is Big data??? We address big data as assets that needs unique platform to deal with bizarre behavior of datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical data storage to manage, mine and analyze accordingly. This bizarre behavior requires three main personalities: volume, velocity, and variety that basically need new architecture, techniques, algorithms, and analytics to uncover the golden and hidden knowledge from information obesity. From these perspectives, we demonstrate our experiences in setting up our Data Science/Big Data platform, algorithms and tool to align with big data plug and play within the academic environment as well as our services to the community and industries.
