Research on counter-terrorism based on big data
In the area of big data, people have a new perspective on counter-terrorism research. In this paper, we have carried out a systematic research on the applications of big data in counter-terrorism field by using quantitative analysis method. And then we have demonstrated effect of big data on counter-terrorism research from data collection and preprocessing, data mining and analysis, monitoring and warning three aspects. After that, we have used all the data of The Times and The New York Times about WUC in 2012 for analysis and argument. Finally, it concludes the deficiencies of the research on the territory of counter-terrorism by using big data and the problems worth studying in the future.
