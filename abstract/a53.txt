Pattern recognition of human arm movement using deep reinforcement learning
Hand gesture recognition is one of the major research areas in the field of Human computer interaction (HCl). This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to recognize the human arm movement patterns using an IoT sensor device. Recent studies have explored supervised learning based methods, such as CNN and RNN to implement the HCl device. On the other hand, the deep reinforcement learning approach has also been investigated. Algorithms using this approach, learn the patterns from sensors using only the reward feedback with no class labels. This allows users to control the IoT device and produce the desired arm movement patterns without creating any labels. In this paper, the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) with the DQN model was compared with that of long short-term memory (LSTM) models with DQN. Results show that the CNN based DQN model was more stable compared to the LSTM based model, and yielded a high classification accuracy of 98.33% to predict the arm movement patterns.
