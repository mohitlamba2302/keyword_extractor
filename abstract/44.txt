Research on analysis system of city price based on big data
This paper attempts to construct an analysis model of city price, by combining the big data system with the information of city price, so as to provide the reference for the government to implement the policy of the accurate price control. This paper considers that the analysis system of city price should include decision-making layer, supporting layer and showing layer on the conceptual level, and its transmission path should include the data collection, data management, data mining, decision making and safety protection. when it comes to the construction of the subsystem, technological tools such as data mining, cloud computing and visualization should be used, mainly in order to build data acquisition subsystem, data management subsystem, data analysis subsystem, data transmission subsystem and so on, and provide the graphic description for the corresponding technological path at the same time.
