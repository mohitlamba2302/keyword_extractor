Digital construction of coal mine big data for different platforms based on life cycle
Big data has penetrated into various industries and business functions, and become important factors of production in the global economy. In the big data technology system, big data collection is the basis. The storage, analysis, integration and visualization of unstructured data and semi-structured data will become an important focus of the big data innovation. Traditional structured data will no longer be the core of big data. Based on the life cycle theory, using new digital technology, such as acquisition, processing, storage, organization and copyright protection, clusters of high concurrency retrieval and dynamic scheduling, intelligent digital display, coal mine industry information data can be collected and integrated, to realize centralized management, unified retrieval and joint exhibition of information resources, to provide technical means and reference for the digital construction of heterogeneous coal mine information data by means of big data thinking.
