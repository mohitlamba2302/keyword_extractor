Neural network routing for multiple stage interconnection networks
Summary form only given, as follows. A Hopfield model neural network can be useful as a form of parallel computer. Such a neural network may be capable of arriving at a problem solution which much more speed than conventional, sequential approaches. This concept has been applied to the problem of generating control bits for a multistage interconnection network. A Hopfield model neural network has been designed that is capable of routing a set of messages. This neural network solution is especially useful for interconnection networks that are not self-routing and interconnection networks that have an irregular structure. Furthermore, the neural network routing scheme is fault-tolerant. Results were obtained on generating routes in a 4*4 Benes interconnection network.<>
