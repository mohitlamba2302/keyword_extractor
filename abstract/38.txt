Big Data Pre-Processing: Closing the Data Quality Enforcement Loop
In the Big Data Era, data is the core for any governmental, institutional, and private organization. Efforts were geared towards extracting highly valuable insights that cannot happen if data is of poor quality. Therefore, data quality (DQ) is considered as a key element in Big data processing phase. In this stage, low quality data is not penetrated to the Big Data value chain. This paper, addresses the data quality rules discovery (DQR) after the evaluation of quality and prior to Big Data pre-processing. We propose a DQR discovery model to enhance and accurately target the pre-processing activities based on quality requirements. We defined, a set of pre-processing activities associated with data quality dimensions (DQD's) to automatize the DQR generation process. Rules optimization are applied on validated rules to avoid multi-passes pre-processing activities and eliminates duplicate rules. Conducted experiments showed an increased quality scores after applying the discovered and optimized DQR's on data.
