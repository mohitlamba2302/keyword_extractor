Improving deep learning performance using random forest HTM cortical learning algorithm
Deep Learning is an artificial intelligence function that imitates the mechanisms of the human mind in processing records and developing shapes to be used in selection construction. The objective of the paper is to improve the performance of the deep learning using a proposed algorithm called RFHTMC. This proposed algorithm is a merged version from Random Forest and HTM Cortical Learning Algorithm. The methodology for improving the performance of Deep Learning depends on the concept of minimizing the mean absolute percentage error which is an indication of the high performance of the forecast procedure. In addition to the overlap duty cycle which its high percentage is an indication of the speed of the processing operation of the classifier. The outcomes depict that the proposed set of rules reduces the absolute percent errors by using half of the value. And increase the percentage of the overlap duty cycle with 15%.
