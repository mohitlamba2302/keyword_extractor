An extended BAM neural network model
Proposes an extended bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural network model which can do auto- and hetero-associative memory. The theoretical proof for this neural network model's stability is given. Experiments show that this neural network model is much more powerful than the M-P model, discrete Hopfield neural network, continuous Hopfield neural network, discrete bidirectional associative memory neural network, continuous and adaptive bidirectional associative memory neural network, backpropagation neural network and optimal designed nonlinear continuous neural network. Experimental results also show that, when it does auto-associative memory, the power of this model is the same as the loop neural network model which can only do auto-associative memory.
