Machine learning for automatic acquisition of Chinese linguistic ontology knowledge
Due to the complexity and flexibility of natural language, automatic linguistic knowledge acquisition and its application research becomes difficult. In this paper, we present a machine learning method to automatically acquire Chinese linguistic ontology knowledge from typical corpus. This study, first, defined the description frame of Chinese linguistic ontology knowledge, and then, automatically acquired the usage of a Chinese word with its co-occurrence of context in using semantic, pragmatics, syntactic, etc from the corpus, final, the above information and their representation act as Chinese linguistic ontology knowledge bank. We completed two groups of experiments, i.e. documents similarity computing, text reordering for information retrieval. Compared with previous works, the proposed method solves the inferior precision of nature language processing.
