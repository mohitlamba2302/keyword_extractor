Data quality assessment for on-line monitoring and measuring system of power quality based on big data and data provenance theory
Currently, on-line monitoring and measuring system of power quality has accumulated a huge amount of data. In the age of big data, those data integrated from various systems will face big data application problems. This paper proposes a data quality assessment system method for on-line monitoring and measuring system of power quality based on big data and data provenance to assess integrity, redundancy, accuracy, timeliness, intelligence and consistency of data set and single data. Specific assessment rule which conforms to the situation of on-line monitoring and measuring system of power quality will be devised to found data quality problems. Thus it will provide strong data support for big data application of power quality.
