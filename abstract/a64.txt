Disturbance-rejection neural network control
A disturbance-rejection neural network control scheme is presented for control of an unknown nonlinear plant. In the scheme, a multilayer neural network is employed to learn the inverse dynamics of the unknown plant and acts as a feedforward controller to control the plant. The effect of disturbances on the output is suppressed by using a paralleled closed-loop control system. The design technique of the compensator in the closed-loop system is discussed. Simulation results show that the presented control scheme works well in the presence of disturbances.
