A novel big-data processing framwork for healthcare applications: Big-data-healthcare-in-a-box
Herein we present a novel big-data framework for healthcare applications. Healthcare data is well suited for bigdata processing and analytics because of the variety, veracity and volume of these types of data. In recent times, many areas within healthcare have been identified that can directly benefit from such treatment. However, setting up these types of architecture is not trivial. We present a novel approach of building a big-data framework that can be adapted to various healthcare applications with relative use, making this a one-stop “Big-Data-Healthcare-in-a-Box”.
