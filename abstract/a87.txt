Big data machine learning using apache spark MLlib
Artificial intelligence, and particularly machine learning, has been used in many ways by the research community to turn a variety of diverse and even heterogeneous data sources into high quality facts and knowledge, providing premier capabilities to accurate pattern discovery. However, applying machine learning strategies on big and complex datasets is computationally expensive, and it consumes a very large amount of logical and physical resources, such as data file space, CPU, and memory. A sophisticated platform for efficient big data analytics is becoming more important these days as the data amount generated in a daily basis exceeds over quintillion bytes. Apache Spark MLlib is one of the most prominent platforms for big data analysis which offers a set of excellent functionalities for different machine learning tasks ranging from regression, classification, and dimension reduction to clustering and rule extraction. In this contribution, we explore, from the computational perspective, the expanding body of the Apache Spark MLlib 2.0 as an open-source, distributed, scalable, and platform independent machine learning library. Specifically, we perform several real world machine learning experiments to examine the qualitative and quantitative attributes of the platform. Furthermore, we highlight current trends in big data machine learning research and provide insights for future work.
